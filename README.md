# Hi there!

I'm Yavuz, a senior undergraduate student studying Computer Science at SabancÄ± University. I'm passionate about Data Science and Machine Learning.

As a Computer Science student at SabancÄ± University, I have developed a strong proficiency in both <b>Python</b> and <b>C++</b>. With Python, I've leveraged its versatility and ease of use to tackle a wide array of projects, ranging from data analysis and machine learning to web development. My experience with C++ extends to implementing efficient algorithms and exploring low-level programming concepts.

Looking ahead, my career aspirations are deeply rooted in the intersection of artificial intelligence and the dynamic realm of media and entertainment. I am particularly drawn to the potential of AI to revolutionize content creation, recommendation systems, and audience engagement in this industry. Leveraging my background in Computer Science, I aim to contribute innovative solutions that enhance user experiences, optimize content delivery, and drive creative storytelling. 

### Tech Stack
 * Numpy
 * Pandas
 * Matplotlib
 * Scikit-learn

## Currently

Currently, I am deeply immersed in exploring the fascinating domain of generative artificial intelligence.
